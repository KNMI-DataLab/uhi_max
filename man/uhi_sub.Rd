\description{
Determines the days without distrubances of weather phenomena such as frontal systems or fog.
Classified according to the rules used in Theeuwes(2016). The following rules are checked:
\itemize{
\item If the hourly rainfall exceeds 0.3mm
\item Or if  the relative humidity is above 80\%
\item Or if the changes is the wind are more than 2m/s
\item Or if the daily mean wind speed is lower than 0.5m/s (This because it is hard to measure these low wind speeds)
}
These settings will leave 25-40\% of the data available for further analysis.
