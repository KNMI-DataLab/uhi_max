\description{
Filters out non-realistic low values downloaded using `download_time_seq`, creates UTC timestamps
from which a 10min sequence is created. The following filters are applied:

\itemize{
\item Temperatures lower than -40 are unrealistic in the Netherlands and are excluded (set to NA)
\item Similarly temperatures above 45 are also excluded (set to NA)
\item In case there are more than 8 identical measurements in a row the value is set to NA
}

If the gap between the measurements is more than 1 hour values
are not interpolated.
